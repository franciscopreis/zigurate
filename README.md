# Zigurate

This is a simple experiment I made a while back when I was learning the DOM with JavaScript. It allows users to convert text into different ideogram formats (bilateral and radial), with real-time visualization and a fully responsive design for both desktop and mobile devices.

## Project Description

This project aims to experiment with various dimensions of language. The name **Zigurate** arises as an indirect reference to the biblical episode known as the Tower of Babel, canonically considered the founding myth for the existence of different languages. Today, we know that this story is based on the Babylonian ziggurat of **Etemenanki**, hence the choice of this name.

From an etymological perspective, _zigurate_ comes from the Akkadian **ziqquratum**, which in turn derives from the word **zaqārum**, meaning “to rise” or “to build high.” This concept could be particularly interesting in designing the visual component of the webpage.

## Features

- Conversion of text into **bilateral** and **radial ideograms**.
- Side-by-side display of original and converted text.
- Fully responsive interface adapting to different screen sizes.
- Horizontally aligned navigation bar across all devices.
- Custom fonts for ideograms.
